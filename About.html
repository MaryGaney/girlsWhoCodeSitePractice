     <p><strong>1.</strong> I got interested in coding when I joined Robotics Club my freshman year. I thought it was really cool how much you could do or what you could make from programming. I also think that computers are fascinating in general. </p>
     <p><strong>2.</strong> Some programming languages I know are Java, JavaScript, a little HTML, and RobotC. </p>
     <p><strong>3.</strong>  I joined GWC so I could find a community of girls who were interested in coding as well as learn more about coding outside of school.</p>
     <p><strong>4.</strong>  Some fun facts about me is that I can solve a Rubikâ€™s Cube, and I have a dog named Peanut.</p>

     <p><strong>1.</strong>  I got interested in coding when I took a Computer Science class over the summer before my senior year. I thought it was fun to learn all the different components of a code and to go through the process of building a code to see what will work in the finished product.</p>
     <p><strong>2.</strong> Since my computer science class was over the
       summer we didn't get to learn many different programming languages so all I really know is Python. </p>
     <p><strong>3.</strong> I joined GWC because I thought that it would be a good way for me to expand on my coding knowledge and to have the
         chance to interact/collaborate with other girls who are also interested in coding. </p>
     <p><strong>4.</strong>  Some fun facts about me are: I'm a triplet and my favorite ice cream flavor is cookie dough.</p>

    <p> <strong>1.</strong>I became interested in coding when my brother showed me how to open the code beside a website and change what it was saying. Although we only changed the headings on the Petsmart website to say childish things, it really helped spark my interest in what was possible through code. I also took a class in my freshman year that made me want to continue learning how to code. </p>
    <p> <strong>2.</strong> I know HTML, CSS, and am currently learning JavaScript</p>
    <p> <strong>3.</strong> Currently, I am a sophomore, during my freshman year I wanted to join the club but I was too nervous to attend the first meeting since I didn't know anyone that would be going. This year it was a bit easier to join since it was on Zoom. I wanted to join GWC to find a supportive group of girls who share interests in the some of the same things. I really enjoy being able to talk to other girls who are interested in coding and work on group projects. </p>
    <p> <strong>4.</strong> A fun fact about me is that I enjoy drawing with chalk. This past summer I stuck to a schedule and created covid-themed or large drawings on my driveway every week. I also plan on entering in a chalk drawing contest next summer.</p>

<p> <strong>1.</strong> I got into coding freshman year when I took AP CSP. I found programming really interesting and wanted to keep learning.</p>
<p> <strong>2.</strong>Some programming languages I know are html, css, javascript, and python.</p>
<p> <strong>3.</strong> I joined GWC because I thought it would be really cool to learn more about coding with a group of supportive girls. My favorite part about the club is how we help each other out with concepts we do not understand and how great the environment is for learning.</p>
<p> <strong>4.</strong> Some fun facts about myself is that I love to read and my favorite animals are the rabbits living around my house's yard.</p>
